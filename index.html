            <p class="text-center about-hedding">About</p>
            <p class="about-para"> <span class="para">Android</span> is a mobile operating system based on a modified
                version of the <span class="highlight">Linux kernel
                    and other open source software</span>, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as
                smartphones
                and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and
                commercially sponsored by <span class="highlight">Google</span>. It was unveiled in <span
                    class="highlight">November 2007</span>, with the first commercial Android
                device, the HTC Dream, being launched in <span class="highlight">September 2008</span> . <br></p>
                <p class="about-para">
                It is free and open-source software; its source code is known as <span class="highlight"> Android Open
                    Source Project (AOSP),</span>
                which is primarily licensed under the Apache License. However most Android devices ship with additional
                proprietary software pre-installed, most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes
                core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform <span class="highlight"> Google
                    Play,</span> and associated Google 
                Play Services development platform. <br></p>
                <p class="about-para">
                Over 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; some with vendor-customized user
                interface and software suite, such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung, and HTC Sense. Competing
                Android ecosystems and forks include Fire </span  class="highlight">OS (developed by Amazon) or LineageOS</span>. However the "Android"
                name and logo are trademarks of Google which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding
                by </span class="highlight">"uncertified"</span> devices outside their ecosystem. <br></p>
                <p class="about-para">
                The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics, such as
                game consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, PCs, each with a specialized user interface.
                Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed
                by Google. Software packages on Android, which use the APK format, are generally distributed through
                proprietary application stores like Google Play Store,<span class="highlight"> Amazon Appstore (including for Windows 11),</span>
                Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery, Cafe Bazaar, and GetJar, or open source platforms like <span class="highlight"> Aptoide
                or </span> <span class="highlight">F-Droid.</span> <br></p>
                <p class="about-para">
                Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones <span class="highlight"> since 2011 and on tablets since 2013.</span> As
                of <span class="highlight"> May 2021,</span> it has over three billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating
                system, and as of <span class="highlight"> January 2021,</span> the Google Play Store features over 3 million apps.<span class="highlight"> Android 12,
